# 7-ruby-code-examples

## 1. Sum of two numbers

#### Using the product method.

#### When you use this method is like having a loop inside a loop that combines all values in array A with all values in array B.

## 2. Counting, Mapping & Finding

#### Find out what the sequence is.

#### Once we know the sequence we can compare all the numbers to find the missing one.

## 3. Regular Expression Example

#### 3.1 We use the cycle method so we can keep switching between the VOWEL regex & the NON-VOWEL regex.

#### 3.2 We convert the string into an array of characters with chars so that we can use the all? method.

## 4. Recursion & Stack Example

#### The idea here is that on each pass of the algorithm we are either taking a number or not taking a number.

#### We branch out & try both outcomes so we can produce all the possible combinations.

## 5. Method Chaining Example

#### Combining methods allows you to take the output produced by one method & pass it into another.

#### Just like a factory production line!

#### You start with some raw materials (input), then through the process of calling these methods, you slowly transform the raw materials into the desired result.

## 6. With Index Example

#### We combine with_index & even? to find if we have to reverse the current word.
#### Gsub without a block returns an Enumerator object, which allows you to chain it with other methods

## 7. Each With Object Example

#### each_with_object takes an argument, which is the object we want to start with. This argument becomes the 2nd block parameter.

#### We are converting the string into an array of characters (char) & then back to a string when we are done (join).

#### We are using a ternary operator to decide what to do, this makes the code shorter.
