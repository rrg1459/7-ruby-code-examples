# Counting, Mapping & Finding
# Letâ€™s say that you want to find the missing number in an arithmetic sequence, like (2,4,6,10).
# We can use a strategy where we calculate the difference between the numbers.
# [2, 2, 4]

# Our goal here is to find out what the sequence is.
# Is it increasing or decreasing?
# By how much?
